INIU,Should be good for short camping trips,"I bought this because we accidentally drained our car battery charging various electronics on a four day camping trip; 2 iPhones, an iPad and a small LED lamp that we use quite a lot, especially overnight.

At 5.3 x 2.8 x 1 inch, the INUI power bank is compact enough to put in a glove compartment or stow under a seat. It's a little heavy at 3/4 lb, but I am not going to be hiking with it. 

It comes with a USB-C to USB-A cord to charge the power bank, The cord is 12 inches long. There is also a case. It's a snug fit, but you can get the INUI  power bank and cord into the case. The case provides a bit of cushion, but its mesh so its not going to protect the unit from liquids. But you want to keep a lithium battery ventilated and not overheat it.

My first test of the unit:
The INUI power bank arrived charged to 53%. I plugged it into a small 2.1 amp USB-A charger; one of those little cubes that plugs into a wall socket. It took about 4 1/2 hours to charge the power bank to 100%. When my iPhone SE 2022 was down to 20% charge, I recharged it through the USB-A output port of the power bank. The iPhone charged to 100% in 2 hours, and the power bank charge fell from 100% to 92 %. (Note that the iPhone SE 2022 is one of the smaller iPhones.) That seems pretty good given the specs on the website for charging bigger phones.

This looks promising for keeping our iPhones charged for a few days, and give us a little piece of mind that we aren't draining the car battery.",i bought this because we accidentally drained our car battery charging various electronics on a four day camping trip 2 iphones an ipad and a small led lamp that we use quite a lot especially overnight at 53 x 28 x 1 inch the inui power bank is compact enough to put in a glove compartment or stow under a seat its a little heavy at 34 lb but i am not going to be hiking with it it comes with a usbc to usba cord to charge the power bank the cord is 12 inches long there is also a case its a snug fit but you can get the inui power bank and cord into the case the case provides a bit of cushion but its mesh so its not going to protect the unit from liquids but you want to keep a lithium battery ventilated and not overheat it my first test of the unit the inui power bank arrived charged to 53 i plugged it into a small 21 amp usba charger one of those little cubes that plugs into a wall socket it took about 4 12 hours to charge the power bank to 100 when my iphone se 2022 was down to 20 charge i recharged it through the usba output port of the power bank the iphone charged to 100 in 2 hours and the power bank charge fell from 100 to 92 note that the iphone se 2022 is one of the smaller iphones that seems pretty good given the specs on the website for charging bigger phones this looks promising for keeping our iphones charged for a few days and give us a little piece of mind that we arent draining the car battery,0.7632,0.0,9,"use_case, favorite_function, concerns",positive

There are a surprisingly large number of inexpensive mobile batteries that have significantly less actual measurement than the capacity as indicated, but the TORQUE5G is almost 20000mA because it fills up fully four times!
I have not measured or calculated with a device, but the speed in my experience is unquestionably fast, recovering to 80-90% in 30 minutes from about 10% remaining. 0-100% takes less than an hour.
I don't charge my laptop or tablet, so I don't know what it can do, but it's more than enough to charge a smartphone, cordless earphones, mobile fan, etc.

Anker,Long lasting power bank,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I only have good things to say about this power bank. It last long, one charge could last you about 48-72hours. I have it in my work bag because I cannot have my phone die while at work and so far it's been very helpful. I wish it came with cords attached to it so I don't have to always remember to take my cord. 
The only concern I have is weight, it's not exactly lightweight and can seem like a lot to carry around.

Anker,Dependable,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This charger is slim, sleek, and compact, just a bit larger than my iPhone itself, it fits perfectly into my handbag.
