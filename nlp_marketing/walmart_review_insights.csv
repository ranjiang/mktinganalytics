INIU,Should be good for short camping trips,"I bought this because we accidentally drained our car battery charging various electronics on a four day camping trip; 2 iPhones, an iPad and a small LED lamp that we use quite a lot, especially overnight.

At 5.3 x 2.8 x 1 inch, the INUI power bank is compact enough to put in a glove compartment or stow under a seat. It's a little heavy at 3/4 lb, but I am not going to be hiking with it. 

It comes with a USB-C to USB-A cord to charge the power bank, The cord is 12 inches long. There is also a case. It's a snug fit, but you can get the INUI  power bank and cord into the case. The case provides a bit of cushion, but its mesh so its not going to protect the unit from liquids. But you want to keep a lithium battery ventilated and not overheat it.

My first test of the unit:
The INUI power bank arrived charged to 53%. I plugged it into a small 2.1 amp USB-A charger; one of those little cubes that plugs into a wall socket. It took about 4 1/2 hours to charge the power bank to 100%. When my iPhone SE 2022 was down to 20% charge, I recharged it through the USB-A output port of the power bank. The iPhone charged to 100% in 2 hours, and the power bank charge fell from 100% to 92 %. (Note that the iPhone SE 2022 is one of the smaller iPhones.) That seems pretty good given the specs on the website for charging bigger phones.

This looks promising for keeping our iPhones charged for a few days, and give us a little piece of mind that we aren't draining the car battery.",i bought this because we accidentally drained our car battery charging various electronics on a four day camping trip 2 iphones an ipad and a small led lamp that we use quite a lot especially overnight at 53 x 28 x 1 inch the inui power bank is compact enough to put in a glove compartment or stow under a seat its a little heavy at 34 lb but i am not going to be hiking with it it comes with a usbc to usba cord to charge the power bank the cord is 12 inches long there is also a case its a snug fit but you can get the inui power bank and cord into the case the case provides a bit of cushion but its mesh so its not going to protect the unit from liquids but you want to keep a lithium battery ventilated and not overheat it my first test of the unit the inui power bank arrived charged to 53 i plugged it into a small 21 amp usba charger one of those little cubes that plugs into a wall socket it took about 4 12 hours to charge the power bank to 100 when my iphone se 2022 was down to 20 charge i recharged it through the usba output port of the power bank the iphone charged to 100 in 2 hours and the power bank charge fell from 100 to 92 note that the iphone se 2022 is one of the smaller iphones that seems pretty good given the specs on the website for charging bigger phones this looks promising for keeping our iphones charged for a few days and give us a little piece of mind that we arent draining the car battery,0.7632,0.0,9,"use_case, favorite_function, concerns",positive,"phone, camping, hiking, car","['i', 'this', 'we', 'our car battery', 'various electronics', '2 iphones', 'an ipad', 'a small led lamp', 'we', 'quite a lot', 'the inui power bank', 'a glove compartment', 'a seat', '34 lb', 'i', 'it', 'it', 'a usbc', 'cord', 'the power bank', 'the cord', 'a case', 'you', 'the inui power bank', 'cord', 'the case', 'the case', 'a bit', 'cushion', 'its mesh', 'its', 'the unit', 'liquids', 'you', 'a lithium battery', 'it', 'my first test', 'the unit', 'the inui power bank', 'i', 'it', 'those little cubes', 'that', 'a wall socket', 'it', 'about 4 12 hours', 'the power bank', 'my iphone', 'down to 20 charge', 'i', 'it', 'the usba output port', 'the power bank', 'the iphone', '2 hours', 'the power bank charge', '100 to 92 note', 'the iphone', 'the smaller iphones', 'that', 'the specs', 'the website', 'bigger phones', 'this', 'our iphones', 'a few days', 'us', 'a little piece', 'mind', 'we', 'the car battery']",-1,negative,NEGATIVE,negative,"travelers, outdoor_enthusiasts","charging_speed, weight"
