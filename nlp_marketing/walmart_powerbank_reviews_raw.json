It's a little heavy at 3/4 lb, but I am not going to be hiking with it. \n\nIt comes with a USB-C to USB-A cord to charge the power bank, The cord is 12 inches long. There is also a case. It's a snug fit, but you can get the INUI  power bank and cord into the case. The case provides a bit of cushion, but its mesh so its not going to protect the unit from liquids. But you want to keep a lithium battery ventilated and not overheat it.\n\nMy first test of the unit:\nThe INUI power bank arrived charged to 53%. I plugged it into a small 2.1 amp USB-A charger; one of those little cubes that plugs into a wall socket. It took about 4 1/2 hours to charge the power bank to 100%. When my iPhone SE 2022 was down to 20% charge, I recharged it through the USB-A output port of the power bank. The iPhone charged to 100% in 2 hours, and the power bank charge fell from 100% to 92 %. (Note that the iPhone SE 2022 is one of the smaller iPhones.) That seems pretty good given the specs on the website for charging bigger phones.\n\nThis looks promising for keeping our iPhones charged for a few days, and give us a little piece of mind that we aren't draining the car battery.",

As someone who's always on the go, this stays in my bag, ready to keep me connected.\n\nI usually charge it overnight, and while it does take a full eight hours to go from zero to one hundred, it's worth it. I've used it to charge my MacBook Air, iPad, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and even helped out a few friends along the way. It's versatile like that.\n\nNow, it's not exactly lightweight—it's got some heft to it. I think a protective case with rubberized edges would be a great addition.
