Initial experience is awful.,"The instructions for use, provided with the PowerBank, are TERRIBLE.   If this is any indication of what you're in for, they start out with, ""Here's the instruction for your better experience"".    My third grader can write better English than this.

It gets worse:  There is a digital display (25 50 75 100).   Nowhere does it explain what these numbers mean.

The power button seems to do nothing.

There is a slide-out on the back side (looks like a typical place to put batteries into a remote).  No explanation in the manual and NOTHING behind the slide-out ... still a complete mystery as to its purpose.",the instructions for use provided with the powerbank are terrible if this is any indication of what youre in for they start out with heres the instruction for your better experience my third grader can write better english than this it gets worse there is a digital display 25 50 75 100 nowhere does it explain what these numbers mean the power button seems to do nothing there is a slideout on the back side looks like a typical place to put batteries into a remote no explanation in the manual and nothing behind the slideout still a complete mystery as to its purpose,-0.0258,neutral,0
